/*
 * What a home-screen shortcut is made of, for a page reached through the
 * introduction server.
 *
 * On a phone, "Add to Home Screen" reads three things from the page: a name, an
 * icon and the address to open. Served as files, the application gets all three
 * wrong there, and none of it is visible until someone tries:
 *
 *   the address   the manifest says "/". Every machine shares the one origin,
 *                 and the shortcut runs in a storage of its own (iOS keeps a
 *                 web app's storage apart from Safari's), so "/" is not the
 *                 machine you were on — it is no machine at all.
 *   the name      "MoonlightWeb" for every shortcut, when a shortcut can only
 *                 ever open one machine and a person with two cannot tell them
 *                 apart.
 *   the icon      fetched by the system outside the page, so outside the service
 *                 worker that holds the application's files — the request lands
 *                 on the introduction server, which answers every unknown path
 *                 with the entry page. A letter on a grey tile.
 *
 * So the shell and the manifest this host hands down the tunnel carry all three
 * in themselves: the name and the machine's identifier written in, the icons as
 * data: URLs that need no second request. A socket visit is left alone — there
 * the origin IS the machine, and "/" is right.
 *
 * Pure functions over bytes, so the rewriting is tested without a server.
