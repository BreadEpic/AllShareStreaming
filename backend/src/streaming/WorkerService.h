/**
 * The launcher service: a stream worker that runs as SYSTEM on the console
 * desktop, so the secure desktop is no longer out of reach.
 *
 * ── Why a service at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The scheduled task of §30 level 1 raises the worker to the user's FULL token,
 * which buys every window an administrator can touch. It does not buy the
 * *secure desktop*: the UAC prompt, the lock screen and the Ctrl+Alt+Suppr
 * screen live on `Winlogon`, a separate desktop of the same window station,
 * and Windows lets nothing below SYSTEM open it. Desktop Duplication started
 * from a user process stops at the switch, and SendInput from a user process
 * reaches nothing there. Parsec, Sunshine and RDP all answer this the same
 * way, and so does this: a tiny LocalSystem service whose only job is to start
 * the worker in the console session with a SYSTEM token.
 *
 * ── What is, and is not, raised ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only the worker. The server that listens on the network, decodes WebRTC,
 * draws the tray and opens the browser keeps running as the ordinary user, as
 * it always has — a network-facing process is the last one to hand SYSTEM to.
 * The service itself never parses anything from the network: it reads one
 * line — a pipe name — from a local pipe, and starts one fixed command.
 *
 * ── The trust boundary, stated plainly ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Any process of the console user may ask the service for a worker, and gets a
 * SYSTEM process talking to pipes it created. That is a real boundary, and it
 * is the same one Parsec's and Sunshine's services have. It is narrowed to what
 * the feature actually needs:
 *
 *  - The service runs ONE command, the image it was installed as, with fixed
 *    arguments. Nothing from the request becomes a path, a flag or a shell word.
 *  - The only thing the request carries is a pipe base name, and it is accepted
 *    only as `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}` — no separator, no traversal, no UNC.
 *  - The caller must be on the active console session (the token behind the
 *    pipe is impersonated and its session id compared), and its image must be
 *    this same executable under the installation directory.
 *  - The worker checks the same thing from its side before it reads a byte of
 *    config: a pipe server that is not this executable is refused.
 *  - The service is demand-start and does nothing until asked.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT claim: a user who can run the installed
 * executable can obtain a SYSTEM worker and hand it a session of their own.
 * The machine's owner installs this on purpose, exactly as they install
 * Parsec; the feature cannot exist without that step, and saying so in the
 * design is better than pretending the check closes it.
 *
 * ── Transport ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Unchanged from level 1: three named pipes per worker, created by the server,
 * their names passed through. Only the DACL grows a SYSTEM entry, since the
 * worker is now SYSTEM. See ConsoleProcess::startThroughService().
