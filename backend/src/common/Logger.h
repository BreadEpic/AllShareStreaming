     * What the host keeps, kept entirely by the host itself — there is no button
     * anywhere that asks the user to tidy their own log.
     *
     * The log was pure append with no ceiling until 16/09/2026, and on the
     * machine that had been running longest it had reached 472 MB over 70 days
     * — a median of 7.4 MB a day, 69% of it the per-host `serverinfo` poll that
     * runs every ~7 s whether or not anyone is streaming. That is not a
     * developer-only shape: a one-host install still writes that poll at the
     * same cadence, so an ordinary user was on course for about a gigabyte a
     * year of a file nothing ever truncated, on the system disk.
     *
     * The promise is a DURATION, not a size: seven days of history. Size is the
     * consequence, and it follows the number of hosts actually being polled all
     * by itself — a host that stops answering stops writing lines, so it stops
     * costing disk, with no activity tracking to build and no bytes-per-host
     * constant to keep up to date as log lines are added or removed. Measured
     * 16/09: ~1.1 MB per host per day, so seven days is ~10 MB for a one-host
     * install and ~135 MB for the eighteen-host bench.
     *
     * kMaxTotalBytes is NOT the budget — it is a brake. It exists for the case
     * the duration cannot defend against: a host logging abnormally (an error
     * loop, a reconnection that never succeeds) would fill a system disk long
     * before seven days were up. In ordinary use it never bites; when it does,
     * retention drops below seven days and the log says so.
