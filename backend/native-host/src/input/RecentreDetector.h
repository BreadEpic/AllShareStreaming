/// Tells a game that keeps warping the pointer back to one spot from an
/// application that leaves it where it was put — and, for the former, turns
/// the client's absolute positions into the deltas the game is really after.
///
/// ── The problem ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// In desktop mode the browser sends where its own pointer IS, and the host
/// places the system pointer there. An old-school first-person game (GoldSrc,
/// Source without raw input, many others) reads the mouse by warping the
/// pointer to the middle of its window every frame and measuring how far it
/// got pushed since. The two fight: the game puts the pointer at the centre,
/// the next client position puts it back where the viewer's pointer is, and
/// the game reads that whole distance — half a screen — as one flick. The
/// view spins, the sky and the floor alternate, and nothing is aimable. On
/// the desktop, where nothing warps the pointer, the same stream is perfect;
/// and a game reading raw input (Unity's, say) never warps either, so it is
/// perfect too. Only the warping kind breaks, and it breaks completely.
///
/// ── The tell ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The host knows where it put the pointer. Before the next placement it
/// looks where the pointer is: if it has moved, someone else moved it, and if
/// it keeps turning up at the SAME spot, that someone is re-centring it. Three
/// returns to one spot is the verdict — a physical mouse at the host does not
/// come back to the pixel, and a window clipping the pointer only pins it to
/// an edge the viewer would have to trace on purpose.
///
/// From then on the client's positions go in as the difference between two
/// consecutive ones, applied from wherever the game keeps the pointer: the
/// game measures exactly the distance the viewer moved. The verdict is
/// dropped again when the pointer stops turning up at that spot for a while
/// (a menu opened, the game quit) — a while, not one miss, because between a
/// placement and the game's next frame the pointer is legitimately elsewhere.
///
/// Platform-neutral arithmetic on purpose: every host reads and places a
/// pointer, and every host has these games.
