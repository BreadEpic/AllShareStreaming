///
/// On X11 every monitor scans out a window of the one root framebuffer, so a
/// CRTC's (x, y) IS its place on the desktop, and the union of the CRTCs is the
/// desktop. A Wayland compositor gives each output its own buffer instead: every
/// CRTC scans out from (0, 0), and the layout — which screen is left of which,
/// at what scale — lives only in the compositor. Read from KMS, a two-monitor
/// Wayland host looks like two screens stacked on the same origin, the desktop
/// comes out the size of the biggest one, and the fraction sent to the absolute
/// device covers the wrong half of what the compositor actually stretches it
/// over: the pointer moves on the screen the viewer is NOT looking at.
///
/// The compositor answers through xdg-output: the logical position and size of
/// each output, in the very space Hyprland, sway, KWin and Mutter spread an
/// absolute device across (their bounding box of all outputs, in logical
/// pixels). That is what WaylandLayout::read collects, and what this picks
/// from.
///
/// Pure arithmetic in the header, like displayPointToDesktop: the choice is the
/// half that can be wrong quietly, and this way every platform's test run
/// exercises it.

/// @param connector the captured display's connector name, as KMS names it
/// @param display   out — the captured display's logical rectangle
/// @param desktop   out — the union of every reported output
/// @return false when no output carries the connector's name, in which case the
///         rectangles are left untouched and the caller keeps what KMS said.
/// A connector name as every compositor would spell it, for matching. The
/// kernel says "HDMI-A-1"; wlroots (Hyprland, sway) and KWin repeat that, but
