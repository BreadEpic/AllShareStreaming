/**
 * The desktop that currently has the input — and how a thread joins it.
 *
 * One window station, `winsta0`, holds several desktops. `Default` is the one
 * with the taskbar and the windows; `Winlogon` is the SECURE desktop, where the
 * UAC prompt, the lock screen and the Ctrl+Alt+Suppr screen live; a screen
 * saver gets a third. Windows switches between them, and both halves of a
 * stream are per-thread-desktop:
 *
 *  - Desktop Duplication duplicates the desktop the CALLING thread is attached
 *    to. Across a switch it answers DXGI_ERROR_ACCESS_LOST, and a thread still
 *    sitting on `Default` cannot open a new duplication until the switch is
 *    undone — which is why a locked screen is a wait rather than a picture.
 *  - SendInput injects into the desktop the CALLING thread is attached to.
 *    From `Default`, nothing reaches a UAC prompt.
 *
 * So the two threads that matter follow the switch instead: `attachThread()`
 * before opening a duplication, and again before injecting.
 *
 * None of this works below SYSTEM — OpenInputDesktop on `Winlogon` is refused
 * outright — which is what the launcher service exists for. Every entry point
 * here is therefore a no-op that reports false when `runningAsSystem()` is
 * false, and the engine behaves exactly as it did before.
