/// Turns what the receiver reports about the link into the bitrate the stream
/// should be encoded at — plan v2, E3; design §9.3.
///
/// ── The idea ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The viewer's bitrate setting is a ceiling, not a promise the link keeps at
/// every moment. When the link narrows — Wi-Fi contention, a neighbour's
/// download, the 4G cell filling up — frames keep being encoded at the
/// setting, queue up in the transport, and every one of them arrives later
/// than the last: that is the pointer trailing the hand, seconds before a
/// single packet is lost. The receiver sees the queue as a rise in one-way
/// delay (LinkFeedback::owdRiseMs) and says so twice a second; this governor
/// answers by lowering the encoder's target at once, and raises it back only
/// when the link has been quiet for a while. A queue that is drained by
/// sending less is a queue the viewer never feels.
///
/// The same idea as WebRTC's delay-based congestion control, kept to the bare
/// bones on purpose: this has one flow, one direction, a receiver that stamps
/// every frame, and an encoder that changes rate between two frames.
///
/// ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
///  - **Overuse**: a delay rise past kOveruseMs (a queue of two frame intervals
///    at 60 fps), any frame gap, or any eviction on the host's own sender.
///    The target drops by kCutPercent at once, and no raise is attempted for
///    kHoldAfterCutMs. A second overuse inside the hold cuts again.
///  - **Quiet**: a delay rise under kQuietMs, no gaps, no evictions. After
///    kQuietBeforeRaiseMs of it the target climbs by kRaisePercent per report,
///    never above the setting. Raising is slow and cutting is fast because a
///    cut costs sharpness for a second and an overrun costs the viewer's hand.
///  - **Floor**: kFloorPercent of the setting, and never under kFloorKbps. Below
///    that the picture is not worth sending; the stream is better off letting
///    the frontend's own ladder move resolution or transport.
///  - **Silence**: no report for kSilenceMs — the feedback channel itself is
///    stuck — reads as overuse once, then nothing until a report comes back.
///  - **Back from the background**: a report flagged `resumed` says the
///    receiver's page was hidden or frozen. Its gaps are frames our own sender
///    evicted while nobody drained them, and its silence was the browser's:
///    the report is not read as overuse, and a standing silence cut is undone
///    at once — the target goes back to where the link had left it — instead
///    of being climbed back in five quiet raises. A cut a real overuse made
///    before the page went away stays.
///  - **Back to a rate the link has proven**: every kGoodHoldMs the target is
///    sampled, and a sample the link then carried for the whole window
///    without a single overuse becomes the link's last good rate. Below it,
///    quiet raises by kFastRaisePercent instead of kRaisePercent; above it,
///    the slow climb stays. Measured on a corporate Wi-Fi (16/09/2026): the
///    link froze for 0.3 to 1.2 s both ways every 20 to 30 s and was clean in
///    between. One freeze is a string of overuse reports while the queue
///    drains — 20 Mbps cut to the 4 Mbps floor in 3.5 s — and the slow climb
///    then kept the picture soft for 30 s on a link long healthy again. The
///    cut still happens at once; only the way back is quicker.
///  - **A probe that fails**: an overuse during a fast climb, or within
///    kProbeGraceMs of its last step, says the link really narrowed. The
///    good rate falls back to where the climb started, so the next climb is
///    a slow one: the rate can overshoot once, not oscillate.
///
/// Pure and clocked by the caller, so it can be tested without a network.
