// Hardware encoding on Linux through VA-API — AMD and Intel behind one API,
// which is the reason it exists. The Linux counterpart of NvencEncoder/AmfEncoder.
//
// ── The same latency decisions as the other three ───────────────────────────
//
// No B-frames (one reference, one frame in flight), an effectively infinite GOP
// with keyframes only on demand, CBR with a one-frame VBV that has the same
// floor RateControl.h gives every other encoder, and intra-refresh where the
// driver offers it. Every one of those was measured on Windows and none of
// them is negotiable here.
//
// ── The surface the encoder owns ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On D3D11 the converter writes an NV12 texture and the encoder registers it.
// Here it is the other way round, because VA-API allocates its own surfaces:
// the encoder creates the NV12 input surface, EXPORTS it as two DMA-BUF planes,
// and GlConvert renders into those. Same zero-copy result, opposite ownership —
// and the reason inputTarget() exists.
//
// ── What the driver writes for us ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// VPS/SPS/PPS and slice headers are the driver's: Mesa's radeonsi (and Intel's iHD)
// generate them from the sequence and picture parameters, and re-emit the
// parameter sets on every IDR — which is what a browser that joins late or
// loses the first keyframe needs. Packed headers supplied by the application
// are supported by both and used by FFmpeg; here they are sent only to a
// driver that has shown it needs them.
//
// ⚠️ And on one machine they were missing EVERYTHING. Measured 16/09/2026 on a
// Radeon 610M (radeonsi "raphael_mendocino", Mesa 25.2.8): every IDR came out as
// the picture alone — `00 00 00 01 26 01 …`, one start code in 39 920 bytes, no
// VPS, no SPS, no PPS. The same binary on a 780M writes all four. A browser
// cannot configure a decoder from that, so it asks for another IDR, gets another
// headless one, and gives up 15 seconds later with "decoder_unsupported": a
// stream that never starts and says nothing useful about why.
//
// It was not the GPU but the Mesa: from 25.x its VA-API frontend (radeonsi, and
// anything else behind it) writes the parameter sets only when the application
// hands them in as packed headers — and reads frame_num and the reference
// picture set from the application's packed slice header, leaving them at zero
// without one. Every AMD host on a current distribution, not one laptop.
//
// So init() encodes ONE throwaway IDR and looks. A driver that writes its
// parameter sets is used exactly as before — no GPU that works today changes
// path. One that does not, and says it takes packed headers, is opened again
// with every header written here (ParameterSets.h): sequence and picture sets
// with each IDR, a slice header with every picture. Mesa parses them and
// re-writes them itself, so they must say exactly what the parameter buffers
// say. A driver that still writes none is refused by name, and the session
// falls back to the CPU pair, which always works.
