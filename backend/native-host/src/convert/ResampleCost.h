/// What the Lanczos-2 resample costs THIS GPU, measured on the stream's own
/// frames rather than assumed from its tier.
///
/// ── Why a measurement ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The resample runs on the 3D queue before the encoder may read the picture,
/// so every microsecond of it is latency on every frame. What it costs depends
/// on the GPU and on nothing a session can name: 1440p → 1080p, measured on
/// 22/09/2026 by A/B against the bilinear fetch, ~0 ms on an RTX 5060 Ti,
/// 0.8 ms on an Arc A380, 4.5 ms on the two-CU iGPU of a Ryzen 7000, 12 ms on
/// an N95. "Integrated" was the obvious proxy, but it names a class, not a
/// cost: integrated GPUs run from two compute units to forty, and a small
/// discrete card can be slower than a large iGPU. So the pass is timed with
/// GPU timestamps and kept only where it is cheap — latency comes before
/// sharpness.
///
/// ── The rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// The first kWarmupFrames frames are not timed: a GPU that was idle a moment
/// ago is still climbing out of its lowest clock (the AMD iGPU took ~1.5 s to
/// settle). Then the median of kSamples frames — a median, so a frame that
/// shared the GPU with a burst of desktop work does not decide it. Above
/// kBudgetUs the stream goes on the bilinear fetch, which costs nothing.
///
/// Pure bookkeeping, so it is tested without a GPU; the platform converter
/// does the timing.
