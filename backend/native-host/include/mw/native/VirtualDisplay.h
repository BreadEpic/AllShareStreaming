// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  A virtual display the engine creates ITSELF, in this process.
//
//  This is the platform seam for the OSes that can conjure a display without
//  a driver: macOS today (CoreGraphics' virtual display, the mechanism behind
//  BetterDisplay and DeskPad), Linux Wayland next (the ScreenCast portal's
//  VIRTUAL source). Windows is deliberately absent: there the display is a
//  third-party IddCx driver installed by an elevated helper, orchestrated
//  above this module (backend/src/backend/VirtualDisplay*.cpp), and nothing
//  here has to know.
//
//  The display lives exactly as long as this process holds it: create() in
//  the server, and it is gone when the server exits. That is a feature — no
//  device node to clean up, nothing left behind on the machine — and it is
//  why the caller re-creates it at startup from its own settings.
//
//  One display per process. A second create() replaces the first.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
