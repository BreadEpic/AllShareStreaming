"""Re-probe the fleet and rewrite chapter 1's access rows.

Run this last, just before the report. The PIN and the rendezvous address in
the report are what the reader will actually use, so they have to be read at
the end — after every pass, every restart and every reinstall — not at the
moment an install happened to finish.

It keeps each machine's install/update steps as they were; only what the
machine says about itself right now is replaced.
