/**
 * StatsGraph — the last minute of the stream, under the stats card's numbers.
 *
 * The overlay's rows say what the stream is doing RIGHT NOW. A number that
 * jumps tells you something moved; it cannot tell you whether the latency is
 * climbing steadily (the link is degrading) or spiked once and came back (a
 * single hitch), and by the time the user looks, the moment is already gone.
 * This class keeps the last 60 seconds of every value the card shows and draws
 * them as four stacked lanes.
 *
 * Four lanes, never one plot: ms, fps, Mbps and % have nothing to do with each
 * other on a shared axis, and a graph with two y-scales is a graph that lies.
 * Two curves share a lane ONLY when they share a unit, and there it is the
 * point — the gap between decoded and presented fps IS the jitter drop.
 *
 *   LATENCY   total (solid) + the composed p99 (hairline)
 *   FRAMERATE decoded in (solid) + presented out (hairline)
 *   BITRATE   filled area — a magnitude reads as an area
 *   LOSS      network loss (solid, red) + jitter drops (hairline, neutral)
 *
 * Plus one vertical tick across all four lanes per recovery / stall / ride-out,
 * because "it froze about ten seconds ago" and "the decoder was rebuilt HERE,
 * while the bitrate collapsed" are two very different bug reports.
 *
 * Sampling is deliberately independent of display: StreamView pushes a sample
 * on every 500 ms overlay tick whether or not the breakdown is open, so opening
 * it right after a hitch shows the minute that CONTAINS the hitch instead of an
 * empty box that fills in once the incident has passed. The cost of that is
 * seven floats per tick.
 *
 * Drawing is pure canvas, on the same 500 ms tick — no rAF, no per-frame work,
 * nothing on the path a frame takes to the screen.
 *
 * The buffers and the scale logic hold no DOM, so they are testable on their
 * own; draw() is the only part that needs a context.
