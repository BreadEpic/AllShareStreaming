/**
 * PipelineDiag — observations of the browser-side WebCodecs pipeline.
 *
 * The overlay's three latency legs (decode / render queue / render) say how
 * long each stage took, but not WHY. They all inflate together as soon as the
 * host framerate rises (static desktop → moving mouse or a video playing),
 * which has two very different explanations that the legs alone cannot tell
 * apart:
 *
 *   - the browser is slower per frame (bigger frames to decode, heavier draw), or
 *   - the pipeline is BACK-PRESSURED: the presentation path (canvas swap chain /
 *     GPU) can't retire frames at the incoming rate, the render guard stays busy,
 *     decoded frames pile up, the decoder's output pool starves and its
 *     submit→output latency grows as a consequence.
 *
 * Under back-pressure the decode leg is a symptom, not a cause — and the fps
 * shown is the DECODED rate, so a pipeline presenting only two thirds of what
 * it decodes still reads "60 fps".
 *
 * This class records the quantities that separate the two:
 *   - frame arrival interval (what the host actually sends),
 *   - VideoDecoder.decodeQueueSize at submit (decoder input pressure),
 *   - decoded-frame queue depth at pump (render can't keep up),
 *   - the draw split into submit vs wait (see VideoRenderer.lastDraw): a high
 *     WAIT with a low submit is presentation back-pressure, not draw cost,
 *   - drops by cause, so the presented-vs-decoded gap is attributable.
 *
 * Instantiated once per pipeline: the worker owns one (its own clock, posted in
 * the counters message) and StreamView owns one for the main-thread path. Pure
 * bookkeeping — no DOM, no WebCodecs — so both contexts can import it.

 * each report a handler run and a message; a frame interval at 120fps is 8.3ms.
 * Whether the two get in each other's way is a question for a measurement, and
 * nothing in PipelineDiag can answer it: a late frame reads the same there
 * whether the network, the decoder or a busy event loop held it up.
 *
 * Three observations, all windowed like the rest:
 *   - input messages sent, and the time their handlers took,
 *   - event-loop lag: how late a 10ms timer fires. It fires late only when the
 *     thread was busy with something else, so its max is the longest stretch
 *     during which a frame that had arrived could not be touched,
 *   - long tasks (>50ms), as the browser reports them.
 *
 * Diagnostics only (mw_perf_diag): the timer runs only between start() and
 * stop(), and noteInput() costs a push.
