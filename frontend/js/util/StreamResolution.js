/**
 * The streamed resolution, from the choice in Settings to the size a launch
 * asks for.
 *
 * Four ways to choose it (`stream_resolution`):
 *   - `auto`   — the default. On the native host: the host display's own size
 *                when it fits this screen, else the host's picture scaled DOWN
 *                (on the host, its shape kept) to fit this screen — a 2560×1440
 *                display on a 2000×1600 laptop streams 2000×1125. The box is
 *                never taller than AUTO_MAX_HEIGHT, so a 4K screen asks for
 *                1440p and neither machine spends a GPU on pixels Auto never
 *                promised. On a phone or a tablet the box is not the screen but
 *                1440 lines by any width (MOBILE_AUTO_BOX): the picture is
 *                pinched and zoomed there, and a stream reduced to the screen's
 *                1170 lines blurs the moment it is; so a host of up to 1440
 *                lines streams as it is and a taller one comes down to 1440,
 *                never below 1080 that way. The stream follows both screens:
 *                the host changing its mode, a computer's window moving to
 *                another monitor. On every other host, which cannot say its
 *                display's size: 1080p, the width from the Auto ratio (measured
 *                from Sunshine's bars).
 *   - `device` — "Match my screen": this screen's size, pixel for pixel. The
 *                native host is asked to put its display in that mode for the
 *                session; when its driver lists no such mode the request falls
 *                back to Auto (`fallback`), which is what the host then gets.
 *                Sunshine and Apollo get the explicit size with GameStream's
 *                optimal-settings flag, which lets them switch the host display
 *                to it. The stream follows this screen's changes.
 *   - `custom` — a width and a height typed in, each within
 *                [CUSTOM_SIZE_MIN, CUSTOM_SIZE_MAX]: the native host fits its
 *                display's shape inside the box, never upscaled.
 *   - `fixed`  — one of the rungs (720p … 2160p) in `stream_height`; the width
 *                follows the host's shape (Auto ratio).
 *
 * Every choice but `fixed` (and `auto` off the native host) fixes the shape
 * itself, so the aspect probe stays out of it — the size IS the request.
 *
 * ── The pixel budget ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A size and a rate are chosen apart and multiply together: 2560×1440 at
 * 120 fps is 442 million pixels a second to capture, scale, encode, send,
 * decode and paint — more than a machine on either end holds for an hour of
 * play. So whenever ONE of the two was left to us (Auto resolution or Auto
 * frame rate), the pair is held under PIXEL_RATE_BUDGET, and the reduction
 * goes to the resolution first (fitPixelBudget): a frame rate is felt on
 * every mouse move, a hundred lines of resolution are not. Neither is ever
 * brought below what the client itself does — BUDGET_MIN_HEIGHT and
 * BUDGET_MIN_FPS, or this screen's own when it is under them. Two explicit
 * choices are the viewer's business and are left alone.
 *
 * ── "MoonlightWeb Virtual Display" ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A display that exists only for this stream is not something to fit into: it
 * is made to measure, so on that one card every choice names an exact size and
 * the display is created at it (`virtualDisplay` in the context). "Match my
 * screen" means this screen pixel for pixel, a fullscreen with no bars
 * anywhere; Auto means the same screen under Auto's own ceiling, so a 4K panel
 * gets a 1440p display rather than a 4K one nobody looks at. Custom is the
 * pair as typed, portrait included. A rung is that many lines at THIS
 * screen's shape — 1080p on a
 * 2532×1170 phone is 2336×1080, not 1920×1080 — because the shape of a
 * display nobody sees has no reason to be anyone else's. Every one of them is
 * held inside [MODE_SIZE_MIN, MODE_SIZE_MAX], the driver's and the decoders'
 * limits, shrunk at its own shape when it does not fit.
