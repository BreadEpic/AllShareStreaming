 * The JSON messages a host sends on the input channel that belong to the
 * stream view — handed to its `onStats` — as opposed to the ones a transport
 * handles itself (take-over, revocation, exit notice…).
 *
 * One list for every transport. There used to be four copies, one per message
 * handler in WebRtcDataChannel and WebRtcMedia, and each new message had to be
 * added to all of them: `cursorpos`, the host's word on where the pointer is,
 * was added to none, so a touch screen drawing the pointer itself never heard
 * it and started from the middle of the picture, uncorrected (found
 * 15/09/2026). A transport that never carries a message (WSS has no pointer
 * messages) loses nothing by listing it.
