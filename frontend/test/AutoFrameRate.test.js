 * "Auto" frame rate: the stream runs at the rate of the screen it lands on.
 * One measurement answers for both halves — the frames per second the host is
 * asked for, and the cadence its virtual display is created at — so what is
 * worth pinning down here is the reading of that measurement: a panel that
 * runs at 164.8 Hz is 165 FPS, and a screen that could not be measured leaves
 * the choice to the caller rather than inventing a rate.
